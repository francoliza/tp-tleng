1. e4 e5 { Unlike a Sicilian or French Defense here Black firmly places a pawn
in front of Pe4, and says "no further". White has tried some extreme measures,
such as a King's Gambit, to get rid of Pe5, but the more common approach these
days is to apply pressure to Black's position all over the board. } 2. Nf3 Nc6
(2...Nf6 { (Petrov's Defense) has also been fairly popular amongst the top GMs
ever since Karpov and Kramnik achieved moderate successes with it.}) 3. Bb5 {
Spanish Game or Ruy Lopez (named after a Spanish priest who was at one time one
of the world's best players -- White threatens to undermine Pe5 by capturing
Nc6. 3. Bc4 (Giuoco Piano or Italian Game) has also been played a lot. } 3...
Nf6 { This is the Berlin Defense. It's not been considered sufficient to
achieve more than equality, but Kramnik used it very successfully against
Kasparov in the Braingames World Championship match. Whether it's the
appropriate "weapon" against Anand is questionable. } (3...a6 { has been the
most common move for many years.}) 4. O-O { White offers Pe4 as a way of
forcing open the e-file when White has castled and Black hasn't. } 4... Nxe4 5.
d4 { trying to get rid of Pe5 while Ne4 blocks it's path. But, Black can let
White capture and leave a pawn on e5. So, Black can keep the e-file closed.
White still tries to get at Ke8. } (5.Bxc6 bxc6 6.Qe2 Nc5 7.Qxe5+ Ne6 { keeps
the e-file closed and Black has the two bishops in exchange for the doubled
c-file pawns.}) 5... Nd6 { Forcing a resolution of the pressure this way is
considered safest. } (5...Be7 6.d5 { is more complicated }) 6. Bxc6 dxc6 7.
dxe5 (7.Nxe5 { opens the e-file, but doesn't achieve much more than that.It
would certainly be a sound move worth playing to face Black with a different
puzzle.}) 7... Nf5 8. Qxd8+ { This is the main advantage of 7. dxe5. It isn't
so easy to clobber Ke8 with queens off the board, but White has an easier time
developing and has a five to four king-side pawn majority. Black, on the other
hand, has the two bishops. } 8... Kxd8 9. Nc3 (9.Ng5 { forces ...Kd8-e8,
keeping the king in the middle of the Black empire or ...Bc8-e6 where White can
capture it to regain one of the bishops.More useful, and what most players aim
for, is to have a Pf5 to prevent ...Be6 before threatening Pf7.This isn't so
easy to achieve.}) ({ A variant on the theme of 9.Ng5 is } 9.Rd1+ Ke8 (9...Bd7
$2 10.Ng5 (10.e6 fxe6 11.Ne5 Bd6 12.Nf7+ Ke7 13.Nxh8 Rxh8 { isn't as bad for
Black because it speeds Black's development }) 10...Nh6 11.e6 fxe6 12.Nxe6+ Kc8
13.Nxf8 Rxf8)) 9... Ne7 { I suppose he is clearing the way for ...Bc8-f5, but
those squares on the king-side in front are risky to occupy. White's pawns
might race forward. } (9...h6 { prevents Nf3-g5 and/or prepares ...Bc8-e6 })
10. Re1 h6 11. h3 Ng6 12. Bd2 { This is a modest move which leaves the bishop
capable of moving to c3 to back up Pe5 or simply guarding square f4. One
noticable key thing about the move is it doesn't weaken his queen-side the way
the b2-b3, Bc1-b2 plan does. } 12... Bd7 13. Ne4 { With Ph3 White restrains
Black's light-square bishop. With Bd2 & Ne4 he restrains Black's dark-square
bishop. This is sensible, but far from an indication of how he might win the
game. I suppose he's just playing a slightly better position and will squeeze
Black while he develops more pieces. } 13... Kc8 { Black is far from completing
his development, but if White doesn't execute a concrete attack he'll have
time. That was the idea Kramnik utilized (as Black) to slow Kasparov. } 14. Ng3
c5 15. Nh5 { This looks promising: he holds Bf8 in place. } 15... b5 16. Nh2
Kb7 17. f4 Nh4 18. Re2 { prepares Bd2-e1 to kick Nh4 and to defend Pc2 while
keeping square f3 firmly in hand } ({ The more forceful way to execute the plan
is to kick Nh4 around to gain time.} 18.g3 Nf5 19.g4 Nd4 20.Rac1 Bc6 21.Kf2
Rd8) 18... Bc6 { now Re2 and Nh5 are aligned perfectly for a Bf3 to fork! All
Black needs is for 19. g3 Nf3+ 20. Nxf3 Bxf3. Also, the d-file is cleared, so
Ra8 can come into play. } 19. c3 (19.Be1 Nf5 20.c3) 19... g6 20. Nf6 Be7 21.
Be1 Nf5 { Black would rather keep lines closed, at least until all his pieces
are equal to White's. Then he might seek to open lines for his bishops. }
(21...Bxf6 $6 22.exf6 Nf5 { makes Pc5 weaker and opens the e-file for Re2.Only
the question of whether Pf6 might be weak is worth considering.It serves well
to support a White piece landing on e7.Probably g2-g4-g5 to support Pf6 is all
that's needed.Certainly Nh2-g4-e5 would make the trade on f6 favor White.}) 22.
Ne4 Ng7 { Black is aware of the importance of White achieving f4-f5 to mobilize
Pe5. It looks a little awkward, but White's maneuvers behind the pawns (Pe5 &
Pf4) look a little awkward too. } 23. Ng4 Rad8 24. Ngf2 (24.Bf2 Ne6 25.g3 h5
26.Ngf6 h4) 24... h5 25. Bd2 (25.g3) 25... h4 { by preventing g2-g3 he keeps
Pe5 & Pf4 slightly weak and always in need of piece support } 26. Be3 Ne6 27.
Nf6 a5 28. N2e4 b4 29. Ng5 { It has taken White a lot of maneuvering moves to
threaten Pf7, and it is completely ineffective. } 29... Rd3 { This is a strong
indication Black has his king-side well organized for defense. If 30. Nxf7 Rf8
Black will regain the pawn by capturing at f6. This game is another indication
of how difficult it can be to get at Black's thorny position. } 1/2-1/2
